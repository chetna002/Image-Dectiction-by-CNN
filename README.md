Dataset Collection:
Make sure you have a dataset that contains images of cats and dogs,
specifically related to respiratory conditions.

Preprocessing the Dataset:
Use the paths.list_images function to load all the image paths,
filter the relevant categories, and apply preprocessing steps like resizing,
normalization, and augmentation if needed.

Model Development:
You can use pre-trained models like ResNet, MobileNet, or VGG16 from libraries like TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.
Transfer learning works well for image classification tasks, especially with medical datasets.
Define the labels for cats and dogs with respiratory problems and healthy ones.

Building the Classification Model:
Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify the
respiratory issues in the filtered images.

Evaluating the Model:
After training, you can evaluate your model using metrics like accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualize the results using confusion matrices, ROC curves, etc.
